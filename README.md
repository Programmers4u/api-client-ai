# P4UClientAI Node API Library

A tool client for communicating with an AI model hub.
Thanks to the tasks you define in the administration panel, you can write your own backend for any application without knowing how to program.

You can access multiple AI models from different vendors in one API. The tool allows for easy and quick implementation of functions that are managed by artificial intelligence models, which we program by describing the task to be performed. The API interface allows you to automate and combine tasks. Thanks to this tool, you can easily create an AI agent that will answer your phone, answer e-mails, chat, write articles or posts on social media.

This library provides convenient access to the REST API from TypeScript or JavaScript.
